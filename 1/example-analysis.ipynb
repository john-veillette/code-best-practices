    "This is, I think, a big improvement over the original code. Notice that, as we increase the level of _abstraction_, what our code is doing becomes more and more clear. It is easy to tell, for instance, that a paired-sample test is just a one-sample test on the paired differences. This is accomplished without particularly detailed comments; it happens organically by using appropriate function names, which abstract away from the minor details of the program. If you use abstraction (such as functions) well, your main script should read a lot like the methods section of your paper. \n",

But also, there are some handy things you can do if you keep your functions in a seperate _module_."
